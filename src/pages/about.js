        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello this is the about page. I'll fill it with true but filler information about myself.</p>
        <p>Zayger was the name of my ~very first~ digimon (Zaegermon probably), and while trying to figure out a username for an art website way back then
            I decided on. . . Zayger! I've gone by a handful of aliases online throughout the years, but this one stuck for whatever reason.</p>
        <p>I enjoy creating fantasy character illustrations, have a love for all kinds of animals, programming, video games, 
            eating, and researching every little thing that piques my interest.</p>
        <p>I've started making art ever since I had something to make it with. The golden era of Neopets is what inspired me to have an interest in computers,
            since I spent a lot of time on there trying to teach myself digital art to draw them and HTML/CSS for my pet pages. Thank you Neopets.</p>
